## Quick overiew of the data:

- **UserSetting**: Settings for the UI so each user can bring it to his own needs or more probably a close relative can adjust the settings for him
- **UserContact**: Contacts that an elder person will save and can access quickly

## App Informations:
The app is intended to help elder people with some basic phone functions.
